Hi, my name is Matthew Tonks. Throughout my career, I realized that the more I succeed with technology, the less I need to rely on it. This created the opportunity to ask better questions and to have the courage to search for answers when I don't have them.

(pause)

My first role out of college was at a small consulting firm, where school experiences alone could not prepare me for the realities of client work. My experience began with an opportunity at a small firm that implemented data pipelines for customers. My first months were hands-on training to learn a tool called Informatica. The process of learning this tool was as hard as my most difficult classes during college. 

(pause)

As training was wrapping up, I was starting to prepare for my interview with the manager of my first project and reworking my resume with the new skills I learned. I was being passed between both the Owner and my team manager to get ready for any questions that would come our way. 

(pause)

A huge red flag appeared during one of these meetings. I got to see the resume that was being sent to the client. It described someone who has been working for years at a high level, specializing in the tools I was being trained in. I was going to be sent headfirst into a project with barely 2 months of training on a tool that I did not know existed until before I joined.

(pause)

I had a decision to make about working here. I wanted the experience desperately, and it was my first job. I wanted to succeed more than anything and thought this would be the perfect experience to do so.

(pause)

Pressure makes diamonds.

(pause)

I started working on my first project. It was an implementation to create a new framework to process multiple EDI file formats. The team we were working with had been using the firm's consultants prior to my joining, and I was added once this project was approved.

(pause)

The continuing team was 2 people at that time. A miracle worker of a Project Manager and a QA worker with a complete lack of qualifications. There had been a developer before, but the client was not happy with that consultant and had been removed from the project. This just meant they had high standards that I needed to meet consistently.

(pause)

Soon after starting and the requirements were defined, and I started the most difficult time of my professional life. We started the true development of the framework. Everything was against us completing the project. We were limited by the number of hours we could work on a project, and that was cut by useless meetings that were sprinkled throughout the week.

(pause)

On the client side, we had daily standups that took an hour due to the dysfunction of the team we were working with. Weekly planning meetings to go through everything we have been working on. And knowledge sharing sessions to learn more about the process and how to cutover from the old process to the new one. On the firm's side, we had the same meetings. On a "good" 40-hour work week, we at minimum had 24 hours of meetings.

(pause)

Then the deadlines started hitting. Our first deadline was approaching, we had added another developer to the project, and we had to keep the client happy. We were stuck with a completely unusable demo, 1 week away from our presentation. I had to work 16-hour days just to be able to show the process working in its entirety. The word exhausted seemed too light for how I felt.

(pause)

But here's where something clicked for me. Instead of just grinding through more 16-hour days, I needed to work differently

(pause)

First, I took ownership of all technical aspects of our framework. I could not rely on our QA person to catch anything if it was truly wrong, so I had to take on those tasks, so when the deployment came, it was bulletproof.

(pause)

Then I did something that probably saved our contract with the client: I started communicating directly with the client's team. No more hiding behind a Project manager putting out PR fires. I started talking to their developers. I hosted knowledge transfer sessions to show them what we built and got their feedback in real-time.

(pause)

The breakthrough came once the client realized the major improvements our framework would provide and how we completely covered all of their file processing needs.

(pause)

The demo went better than we thought possible. But more importantly, I figured out how to navigate impossible projects. After this, I knew my career would not be defined by technical skills, but my adaptability and my ability to learn
