Hi, my name is Matthew Tonks. Throughout my career, I realized that the more I succeed with technology, the less I need to rely on it. This created the opportunity to ask better questions and to have the courage to search for answers when I don't have them.

(pause)

My first role out of college was at a small consulting firm doing data pipeline implementations. My first months were hands on training with a tool called Informatica.

(pause)

As training wrapped up, I was preparing for my first project interview when a huge red flag appeared. I saw the resume that was being sent to the client. It described someone who had been working for years at a high level with these tools. I was being sent headfirst into a project with barely 2 months of training on a tool I didn't know existed until after I joined.

I had a decision to make. I wanted the experience desperately since it was my first job and I wanted to succeed more than anything.

Pressure makes diamonds.

The project was implementing a framework to process multiple EDI file formats. The team was just 2 people: a miracle worker Project Manager and a QA worker with zero qualifications. There had been a developer before, but the client removed them for poor performance. They had high standards I needed to meet consistently.

(pause)

Soon we started development, and I entered the most difficult time of my professional life. We were limited by hours we could work, cut further by useless meetings from both the client and our firm. Daily standups took an hour due to team dysfunction, weekly planning meetings took longer, and don't get me started with the knowledge sharing sessions. On a "good" 40-hour work week, we had 24 hours of meetings minimum.

(pause)

Then deadlines hit. We were stuck with a completely unusable demo 1 week away from presentation. I had to work 16-hour days just to show the process working. Exhausted seemed too light for how I felt.

(pause)

But here's where something clicked. Instead of grinding through more 16-hour days, I needed to work differently.

First, I took ownership of all technical aspects. I couldn't rely on our QA person, so I had to ensure everything was bulletproof for deployment.

Then I did something that probably saved our contract: I started communicating directly with the client's team. No more hiding behind project management. I talked to their developers, hosted knowledge transfer sessions, and got usable feedback.

(pause)

The breakthrough came when the client realized the major improvements our framework would provide and how we completely covered their file processing needs.

(pause)

The demo went better than we thought possible. But more importantly, I figured out how to navigate impossible projects. After this, I knew my career would not be defined by technical skills, but by my adaptability and my ability to learn.
