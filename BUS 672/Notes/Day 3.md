Perception

cognitive load

- intrinsic extraneous and germane load

pre attentive Attributes

- definition

Design philosophies

- Tufte
- Few
- Cairo

Principles

Data visualization is not just about accuracy but also perception

People make instant judgements based on what they see

Poorly designed visuals mislead confuse or overwhelm them

its based on trust of the presentation and shows you

Gestalt principle

- proximity

  - items that are close together are perceived as a group
- Continuity
  - our eyes follow lines curves patterns
- Similarity
  - Items that look alike same color shape size are grouped mentally
- Closure
  - We fill in missing information to see complete shapes

Shap analysis

- given a variable how much does this effect the outcome

Center of the page has more impact

use it to compare two sides

Harvey balls

Manipulations

Triangles to draw eyes to rationale in the background

Iconography is very important to symbolize categories

## Cognitave Load

### Limits of working memory

Humans can only hold 4-7 items in their working memory

Overloading visuals cognitive strain missed insights

Goal reduce unnecessary load

emphasize key insights

### Cognitive Load

- Intrinsic Load
  - Inherent complexity of the data
  - Designers can structure and scaffold data to make it manageable
- Extraneous Load
  - Cognitive effort caused by poor design
  - Avoidable noise that steals attention from meaning

- Germane Load
  - Productive mental effort dedicated to extracting insights
  - Good visuals encourage interpretation rather than more decoding
  - Use colors size annotations

### Practical takeaways

- Is the difficulty from the data or from my presentation
- Strip away extraneous elements
- Use visual hierarchy Color size annotations can support germane load
- Balance Detail with enough context to understand with not to much overwhelms

### Pre attentive attributes

- Processes by the brain in < 200ms before conscious thought
- Instantly guide attention
- Core attributes color size shape orientation Position length texture

- dont compete for attention and draw your viewers first

- subtle cues hidden within design draw attention

red for 'bad'

orange yellow for highlighting in contrast to another color

#### Why it matters

- Guides audience to what matters instantly
- reduces cognitive strain
- Helps highlight outliers trends calls to action
- BUT: overuse can lead to noise distraction and manipulation (to the wrong decision)

Keep consistent formatting and color scheme everytime

## Design Principles

Combine these principles to showcase data

### Tufte

Philosophy visualization is a moral responsibility visuals should not distract from the truth of the data

- Minimalism clarity integrety
- Above all show the data
- Data-ink ration maximize data minimize decoration
- BUT: Overuse can lead to noise distraction and manipulation

### Few's Perspective

Philosophy dfocus on business dashboards and decision support. Visuals are tools for action

- Pragmatic functional design for business
- Truth = enabling better decisions
- Dont just show data make it usable
- Emphasize comparisons, relationships, context
- s

### Cairo

emphasis on moral dimension
visuals can pursuade mislead or empower
designers carry ethical responsibility

- Visualization = Ethical actt
- Goa Be truthful functional and beautiful
- Avoid manipulation and bias
- Balance accuracy clarity and engagement

review visualizations and take a step back to look at possible missinterpretations

### Implications

- Use preattentive attributes
  - THink about purpose
- Reduce cognitive load
  - Simplify declutter structure
- Balance
  - Clarity function ethics
- Ask
  - Does this visual tell the truth
