Disturbed by their cruelty, Benoît distances himself and finds himself alone once more. Refusing to remain silent, he embarks on a personal journey to understand their behavior and try to bring about change. Through Benoît’s struggle, the film thoughtfully explores the complexity of teenage social dynamics, the pressure to conform, marginalization, and the deep need for belonging. It also examines the double-edged role of social media — as a tool for connection and exclusion alike.
