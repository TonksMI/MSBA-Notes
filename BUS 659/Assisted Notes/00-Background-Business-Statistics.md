# Background: Business Statistics Fundamentals

## Overview
This document covers essential statistical concepts needed for BUS 659 from a managerial perspective. These concepts form the foundation for understanding machine learning applications in business contexts.

## 1. Statistical Thinking for Managers

### What is Statistics in Business?
Statistics is the science of **collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data** to make informed business decisions under uncertainty.

**Key Business Applications:**
- **Market Research**: Understanding customer preferences and behavior
- **Quality Control**: Monitoring and improving product/service quality
- **Financial Analysis**: Risk assessment and performance measurement
- **Operations Research**: Optimizing processes and resource allocation

### The Role of Data in Decision Making

**Data-Driven Decision Making Process:**
1. **Problem Definition**: What business question are we trying to answer?
2. **Data Collection**: What data do we need and how do we get it?
3. **Analysis**: What patterns or insights can we extract?
4. **Interpretation**: What do the results mean for our business?
5. **Action**: What decisions should we make based on the analysis?

### Types of Business Problems
- **Descriptive**: What happened? (Historical analysis)
- **Diagnostic**: Why did it happen? (Root cause analysis)
- **Predictive**: What will happen? (Forecasting)
- **Prescriptive**: What should we do? (Optimization)

## 2. Data Types and Business Metrics

### Data Types

#### Quantitative Data
**Continuous:**
- Revenue ($1,234.56)
- Customer satisfaction scores (7.8/10)
- Time to resolution (45.3 minutes)

**Discrete:**
- Number of customers (1,247)
- Units sold (500)
- Website visits (12,453)

#### Qualitative Data
**Nominal (Categories):**
- Customer segments (Premium, Standard, Basic)
- Product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Books)
- Geographic regions (North, South, East, West)

**Ordinal (Ranked):**
- Service quality ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
- Priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Employee performance ratings (1-5 scale)

### Key Business Metrics

#### Financial Metrics
- **Revenue**: Total income from sales
- **Profit Margin**: Percentage of revenue that becomes profit
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Efficiency of investment
$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Investment Cost}} \times 100\%$$

#### Customer Metrics
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Total value a customer brings
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Cost to acquire a new customer
- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who stop using service
$$\text{Churn Rate} = \frac{\text{Customers Lost}}{\text{Total Customers at Start}} \times 100\%$$

#### Operational Metrics
- **Productivity**: Output per unit of input
- **Quality Scores**: Defect rates, error rates
- **Cycle Time**: Time to complete a process

## 3. Descriptive Statistics for Business

### Measures of Central Tendency

#### Mean (Average)
$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

**Business Application:** Average order value, mean customer satisfaction
**When to Use:** When data is normally distributed without extreme outliers
**Example:** Average monthly sales = $125,000

#### Median
**Business Application:** Median household income, median response time
**When to Use:** When data has outliers or is skewed
**Example:** Median customer age = 34 years (less affected by very young/old customers)

#### Mode
**Business Application:** Most popular product, most common complaint category
**When to Use:** For categorical data or finding the most frequent value
**Example:** Mode of payment method = "Credit Card"

### Measures of Variability

#### Standard Deviation
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

**Business Interpretation:**
- **Low Standard Deviation**: Consistent performance (reliable)
- **High Standard Deviation**: Variable performance (unpredictable)

**Example:**
```
Store A daily sales: $1,000 ± $50 (consistent)
Store B daily sales: $1,000 ± $300 (unpredictable)
```

#### Coefficient of Variation
$$\text{CV} = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100\%$$

**Use Case:** Compare variability across different scales
**Example:** Comparing sales variability between high-volume and low-volume stores

### Business Dashboard Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```
Monthly Business Dashboard:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Metric          │ This Month  │ Last Month   │
├─────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Revenue         │ $125,000    │ $118,000     │
│ New Customers   │ 847         │ 792          │
│ Churn Rate      │ 3.2%        │ 3.8%         │
│ Avg Order Value │ $67.50      │ $65.20       │
│ Customer Sat.   │ 4.2/5.0     │ 4.1/5.0      │
└─────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘
```

## 4. Probability for Business Decisions

### Basic Probability Concepts

#### Probability Rules
**Addition Rule:**
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

**Multiplication Rule:**
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$$

#### Business Applications

**Marketing Campaign Example:**
- P(Email Open) = 0.25
- P(Click | Email Open) = 0.12
- P(Email Open and Click) = 0.25 × 0.12 = 0.03

### Conditional Probability and Business Intelligence

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

**Customer Segmentation Example:**
- P(Purchase | Premium Customer) = 0.45
- P(Purchase | Standard Customer) = 0.12

**Risk Assessment Example:**
- P(Default | Low Credit Score) = 0.15
- P(Default | High Credit Score) = 0.02

### Expected Value in Business

$$E[X] = \sum_{i} x_i \times P(x_i)$$

**Investment Decision Example:**
```
Project A Expected Value:
Success (70%): +$100,000
Failure (30%): -$20,000
E[Project A] = 0.7 × $100,000 + 0.3 × (-$20,000) = $64,000
```

## 5. Sampling and Business Research

### Sampling Methods

#### Simple Random Sampling
**Use Case:** Customer satisfaction surveys
**Advantage:** Unbiased representation
**Challenge:** May miss important subgroups

#### Stratified Sampling
**Use Case:** Market research across demographic groups
**Method:** Sample proportionally from each stratum
**Example:** Survey 100 customers from each age group (18-30, 31-50, 51+)

#### Systematic Sampling
**Use Case:** Quality control in manufacturing
**Method:** Select every nth item
**Example:** Test every 100th product off the production line

### Sample Size Determination

**Factors Affecting Sample Size:**
- **Confidence Level**: How sure do we want to be? (90%, 95%, 99%)
- **Margin of Error**: How precise do we need to be? (±3%, ±5%)
- **Population Variability**: How diverse is our population?

**Rule of Thumb for Business:**
- **Small surveys**: 100-300 responses
- **Market research**: 400-1,000 responses  
- **National studies**: 1,000+ responses

## 6. Business Forecasting Fundamentals

### Time Series Components

$$Y_t = T_t + S_t + C_t + I_t$$

Where:
- $T_t$ = Trend (long-term direction)
- $S_t$ = Seasonal (regular patterns)
- $C_t$ = Cyclical (business cycles)
- $I_t$ = Irregular (random variation)

### Simple Forecasting Methods

#### Moving Average
$$\text{Forecast}_{t+1} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} Y_{t-i}$$

**Use Case:** Short-term sales forecasting
**Advantage:** Simple and smooth
**Limitation:** Lags behind trends

#### Exponential Smoothing
$$\text{Forecast}_{t+1} = \alpha Y_t + (1-\alpha)\text{Forecast}_t$$

**Parameter α:** Controls how much weight to give recent observations
- High α (0.7-0.9): Responsive to changes
- Low α (0.1-0.3): Smooth, stable predictions

## 7. Statistical Quality Control

### Control Charts

**Upper Control Limit (UCL):** $\bar{x} + 3\sigma$
**Lower Control Limit (LCL):** $\bar{x} - 3\sigma$

**Business Applications:**
- **Manufacturing**: Product defect rates
- **Service**: Customer response times
- **Finance**: Daily transaction volumes
- **HR**: Employee productivity metrics

### Process Capability

**Process Capability Index:**
$$C_p = \frac{\text{Specification Width}}{6\sigma}$$

**Interpretation:**
- $C_p > 1.33$: Excellent process
- $C_p > 1.00$: Adequate process
- $C_p < 1.00$: Poor process (needs improvement)

## 8. Business Intelligence and Reporting

### Dashboard Design Principles

**The 5-Second Rule:** Key insights should be visible within 5 seconds

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Most Important**: Large, top-left position
2. **Secondary**: Medium size, prominent placement
3. **Supporting**: Smaller, organized logically

### Statistical Significance in Business

$$\text{t-statistic} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

**A/B Testing Example:**
- Version A conversion rate: 12.5%
- Version B conversion rate: 14.2%
- Question: Is the difference statistically significant?

**Business Decision Framework:**
1. **Statistical Significance**: Is the difference real?
2. **Practical Significance**: Is the difference meaningful?
3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Is it worth implementing?

## Key Takeaways for Managers

### 1. Data Quality Matters
- **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: Poor data leads to poor decisions
- **Representative Samples**: Ensure your data reflects your target population
- **Clean Data**: Address missing values, outliers, and errors

### 2. Understand Uncertainty
- **Confidence Intervals**: "We're 95% confident the true value is between X and Y"
- **Margin of Error**: All estimates have some uncertainty
- **Risk Assessment**: Use probability to quantify business risks

### 3. Context is Critical
- **Statistical Significance ≠ Business Significance**
- **Correlation ≠ Causation**
- **External Factors**: Consider market conditions, seasonality, competition

### 4. Communication is Key
- **Tell a Story**: Use data to support a narrative
- **Visual Communication**: Charts often communicate better than tables
- **Know Your Audience**: Technical detail for analysts, insights for executives

## Common Business Statistics Mistakes

### 1. Survivorship Bias
**Problem:** Only analyzing successful cases
**Example:** Only studying profitable customers, ignoring churned customers
**Solution:** Include all relevant data, not just positive outcomes

### 2. Simpson's Paradox
**Problem:** Trends reverse when data is aggregated
**Example:** Overall satisfaction decreases but satisfaction increases in each segment
**Solution:** Always analyze data at appropriate granularity

### 3. Regression to the Mean
**Problem:** Extreme values tend to be closer to average on repeat measurement
**Example:** Assuming poor-performing stores will continue poor performance
**Solution:** Understand natural variation in business metrics

### 4. Selection Bias
**Problem:** Sample doesn't represent the population
**Example:** Online surveys only capture tech-savvy customers
**Solution:** Use appropriate sampling methods for your target population
