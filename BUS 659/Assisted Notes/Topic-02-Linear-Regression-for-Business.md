# Topic 2: Linear Regression for Business

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, managers should understand:
- When and how to use linear regression for business problems
- How to interpret regression coefficients in business terms
- Common assumptions and their business implications
- How to validate and improve regression models

## 1. Linear Regression Fundamentals

### What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression models the relationship between a **dependent variable** (what we want to predict) and one or more **independent variables** (what we use to predict).

**Mathematical Form:**
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon$$

Where:
- $y$ = Dependent variable (target)
- $\beta_0$ = Intercept (baseline value)
- $\beta_i$ = Coefficients (effect of each variable)
- $x_i$ = Independent variables (predictors)
- $\epsilon$ = Error term (unexplained variation)

### Business Applications

#### Sales Forecasting
**Problem**: Predict monthly sales based on advertising spend
```
Model: Sales = β₀ + β₁ × (TV Ads) + β₂ × (Online Ads) + ε

Example Result:
Sales = $50,000 + $3.2 × (TV Ads) + $1.8 × (Online Ads)

Interpretation:
- Baseline sales (no ads): $50,000
- Each $1 in TV advertising increases sales by $3.20
- Each $1 in online advertising increases sales by $1.80
- ROI: TV ads have higher return than online ads
```

#### Pricing Analysis
**Problem**: How does price affect demand?
```
Model: Demand = β₀ + β₁ × Price + β₂ × Competition + ε

Example Result:
Demand = 10,000 - 50 × Price - 20 × Competition

Business Insights:
- Price elasticity: -50 units per $1 price increase
- Competition impact: -20 units per additional competitor
- Strategic implication: Differentiation more valuable than price cuts
```

## 2. Model Building and Interpretation

### Step-by-Step Business Process

#### Step 1: Problem Definition
**Framework Questions:**
1. What business outcome are we trying to predict?
2. What factors might influence this outcome?
3. What data do we have available?
4. How will we use the predictions?

#### Step 2: Data Exploration
**Key Analyses:**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Which variables are related?
- **Scatter Plots**: What does the relationship look like?
- **Outlier Detection**: Are there unusual data points?
- **Missing Data**: How complete is our dataset?

#### Step 3: Model Fitting
**R Example:**
```r
# Load business data
sales_data <- read.csv("monthly_sales.csv")

# Fit regression model
model <- lm(Sales ~ TV_Ads + Online_Ads + Seasonality + Competition, 
            data = sales_data)

# View results
summary(model)
```

#### Step 4: Interpretation
**Coefficient Interpretation Guide:**

$$\beta_i = \frac{\text{Change in } y}{\text{1-unit change in } x_i}$$

**Example Interpretations:**
- **$\beta_1 = 3.2$**: "Each additional $1,000 in TV advertising is associated with $3,200 in additional sales"
- **$\beta_2 = -15$**: "Each additional competitor is associated with 15 fewer units sold per month"
- **$\beta_3 = 0.8$**: "Each 1% increase in customer satisfaction is associated with 0.8% increase in retention rate"

### Statistical Significance vs Business Significance

#### P-Values and Business Decisions
**Statistical Significance**: Is the coefficient statistically different from zero?
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant
- p ≥ 0.05: Not statistically significant

**Business Significance**: Is the effect large enough to matter?
- Small but statistically significant effects may not be actionable
- Large effects with marginal significance may still be important

**Example Analysis:**
```
TV Advertising Coefficient Analysis:
- Coefficient: $2.10 per $1 spent
- P-value: 0.03 (statistically significant)
- Business question: Is $2.10 ROI worth the effort?
- Decision factors: Cost of campaign management, brand benefits, strategic alignment
```

### R-Squared and Model Performance

**R-Squared Interpretation:**
$$R^2 = \frac{\text{Explained Variation}}{\text{Total Variation}}$$

**Business Translation:**
- R² = 0.65: "Our model explains 65% of the variation in sales"
- Remaining 35%: Due to factors not in our model or random variation

**Model Performance Guidelines:**
- R² > 0.70: Strong explanatory power
- R² 0.50-0.70: Moderate explanatory power  
- R² < 0.50: Weak explanatory power (but may still be useful)

**Important Note**: High R² doesn't guarantee good predictions for new data!

## 3. Assumptions and Diagnostics

### Key Assumptions

#### 1. Linearity
**Assumption**: Relationship between x and y is linear
**Business Check**: Do scatter plots show straight-line relationships?
**Violation**: Curved relationships, threshold effects

**Example Violation**: 
```
Price vs Demand might have threshold effects:
- Small price increases: little effect on demand
- Large price increases: dramatic demand drop
Solution: Consider non-linear transformations or piecewise models
```

#### 2. Independence
**Assumption**: Observations are independent of each other
**Business Check**: No systematic patterns in residuals over time
**Violation**: Time trends, seasonal patterns, clustering

**Common Business Violations:**
- **Time Series Data**: This month's sales affect next month's sales
- **Geographic Clustering**: Stores in same region perform similarly
- **Customer Segments**: Enterprise vs SMB customers behave differently

#### 3. Homoscedasticity
**Assumption**: Error variance is constant across all levels
**Business Check**: Residual plots should show constant spread
**Violation**: Prediction errors increase with size of prediction

**Example**: 
```
Large customers may have more variable spending patterns
- Small customers: $1K ± $100 (10% variation)
- Large customers: $100K ± $20K (20% variation)
Solution: Use weighted regression or log transformations
```

#### 4. Normality of Errors
**Assumption**: Errors are normally distributed
**Business Impact**: Affects confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
**Check**: Histogram of residuals, Q-Q plots

### Diagnostic Tools

#### Residual Analysis
```
Residual = Actual Value - Predicted Value
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Random scatter**: Good model fit
- **Patterns**: Model assumptions violated
- **Outliers**: Unusual data points requiring investigation

**Business Example:**
```
Sales Forecast Residuals Analysis:
Month    Actual   Predicted   Residual   Interpretation
Jan      $120K    $115K       +$5K      Slightly higher than expected
Feb      $90K     $110K       -$20K     Major underperformance (investigate!)
Mar      $125K    $120K       +$5K      Close to expectation
Apr      $200K    $118K       +$82K     Outlier (new product launch?)
```

## 4. Advanced Applications

### Multiple Regression Strategy

#### Variable Selection Process
1. **Start with domain knowledge**: What factors should theoretically matter?
2. **Correlation analysis**: Which variables are related to the outcome?
3. **Stepwise selection**: Systematically add/remove variables
4. **Business validation**: Do the results make practical sense?

#### Multicollinearity Management
**Problem**: When predictor variables are highly correlated with each other
**Detection**: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) > 10
**Business Example**: 
```
Problematic variables in sales model:
- Total Marketing Spend: $50K
- TV + Online + Print Spend: $50K
These measure the same thing! Choose one.
```

**Solutions:**
- **Combine variables**: Create marketing budget index
- **Drop variables**: Keep the most important/interpretable
- **Use regularization**: Lasso or Ridge regression (covered later)

### Categorical Variables

#### Dummy Variable Encoding
**Business Problem**: Including region in a sales model
```
Original Data:
Customer   Region    Sales
A          North     $1000
B          South     $800
C          East      $1200

Dummy Variable Encoding:
Customer   North   South   East    Sales
A          1       0       0       $1000
B          0       1       0       $800
C          0       0       1       $1200
(West is reference category: North=0, South=0, East=0)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **North coefficient (+$200)**: North region averages $200 more than West
- **South coefficient (-$50)**: South region averages $50 less than West
- **East coefficient (+$300)**: East region averages $300 more than West

### Interaction Effects

**Business Question**: Does advertising effectiveness depend on seasonality?
```
Model: Sales = β₀ + β₁×Ads + β₂×Holiday + β₃×(Ads × Holiday) + ε

Results:
Sales = $100K + $2×Ads + $20K×Holiday + $1×(Ads × Holiday)

Interpretation:
- Normal period: $2 return per $1 advertising
- Holiday period: $3 return per $1 advertising ($2 + $1 interaction)
- Business insight: Increase advertising spend during holidays!
```

## 5. Model Validation and Improvement

### Cross-Validation for Business Models

#### Time-Series Split Validation
```
For business forecasting, respect time ordering:

Training Data: Jan-Sep (9 months)
Test Data: Oct-Dec (3 months)

Why? Models should predict future, not interpolate past
```

#### Performance Metrics
**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
$$MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$

**Business Interpretation**: "On average, our predictions are off by $15,000"

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):**
$$MAPE = \frac{100\%}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i}\right|$$

**Business Interpretation**: "On average, our predictions are off by 12%"

### Model Improvement Strategies

#### 1. Feature Engineering
**Log Transformations**: For skewed business data
```
Original: Revenue ranges from $1K to $10M (highly skewed)
Log Transform: log(Revenue) ranges from 3 to 7 (more normal)
```

**Polynomial Features**: For non-linear relationships
```
Customer Age might have quadratic effect on spending:
Spending = β₀ + β₁×Age + β₂×Age² + ε
```

**Ratio Variables**: Often more meaningful than raw numbers
```
Instead of: Revenue, Customers
Use: Revenue per Customer (average order value)
```

#### 2. Outlier Management
**Detection Methods:**
- **Statistical**: Points beyond 3 standard deviations
- **Business**: Domain knowledge of unusual values
- **Visual**: Scatter plots and box plots

**Business Approach to Outliers:**
```
Outlier Investigation Checklist:
□ Is this a data entry error?
□ Does this represent a special event?
□ Is this a different type of customer/product?
□ Should we model this separately?
□ Can we learn from this unusual case?
```

## Common Business Pitfalls

### 1. Correlation vs Causation
**Problem**: Interpreting regression coefficients as causal effects
**Example**: "Ice cream sales predict crime rates" (both increase with temperature)
**Solution**: Use domain knowledge and experimental design

### 2. Extrapolation
**Problem**: Making predictions outside the range of training data
**Example**: Using a model trained on $10K-$100K customers to predict $500K customer behavior
**Solution**: Clearly define model's valid range

### 3. Overfitting to Historical Patterns
**Problem**: Model captures noise, not signal
**Example**: Including too many variables that worked in the past
**Solution**: Regular validation on new data

### 4. Ignoring Business Context
**Problem**: Focusing only on statistical significance
**Example**: Statistically significant but practically meaningless effects
**Solution**: Always consider business significance and implementation costs

## Key Takeaways for Managers

### 1. Linear Regression is a Powerful Starting Point
- Easy to interpret and explain
- Provides baseline for more complex methods
- Reveals key business relationships

### 2. Focus on Business Interpretation
- Coefficients have direct business meaning
- Statistical significance ≠ business significance

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Coefficient Interpretation
A retail company's sales model shows:
```
Sales = $50,000 + $2.50 × Marketing + $1.20 × Store_Size - $800 × Competition
```

**Questions:**
1. What does each coefficient mean in business terms?
2. If marketing budget increases by $10,000, what's the expected sales impact?
3. How would you use this model to optimize marketing spend?

### Exercise 2: Model Diagnostics
You notice that your sales forecasting model has higher errors for larger stores:
- Small stores: ±$5K error
- Large stores: ±$25K error

**Questions:**
1. What assumption is likely violated?
2. How would you investigate this further?
3. What are two possible solutions?

### Exercise 3: Business Decision Making
Two models for customer lifetime value prediction:

**Model A**: R² = 0.75, uses 8 variables, complex interactions
**Model B**: R² = 0.68, uses 3 variables, simple interpretation

**Questions:**
1. What additional information would help you choose?
2. Under what circumstances would you prefer Model B?
3. How would you validate your choice?
