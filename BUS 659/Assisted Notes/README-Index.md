## Managerial Decision Framework

### When to Use ML Models
1. **Problem Identification**: Is this a prediction or classification problem?
2. **Data Availability**: Do we have sufficient, quality data?
3. **Business Impact**: Will improved predictions drive meaningful business value?
4. **Resource Requirements**: Do we have the technical resources and expertise?
5. **Interpretability Needs**: How important is understanding "why" vs "what"?

### Model Selection Criteria
- **Interpretability**: Decision trees > Linear models > Random forests > Deep learning
- **Accuracy**: Deep learning > Random forests > Linear models > Decision trees
- **Speed**: Linear models > Decision trees > Random forests > Deep learning
- **Data Requirements**: Linear models (low) < Decision trees < Random forests < Deep learning (high)

## Key Performance Indicators

### Model Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Of predicted positives, how many are actually positive?
- **Recall**: Of actual positives, how many did we catch?
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

### Business Performance Metrics
- **ROI**: Return on investment from ML implementation
- **Cost Reduction**: Operational savings from automation
- **Revenue Increase**: Additional revenue from better predictions
- **Risk Reduction**: Decreased losses from better risk assessment

## Study Tips for Managers
