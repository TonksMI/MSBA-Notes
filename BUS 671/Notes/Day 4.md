## Cardinality Constraint

- Cardinality Constraint
  - A rule that specifies the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity
- Ex1
  - An employee can complete many courses 
  - a course is completed by many employees

- Ex2
  - One or many is placed for one or more is crows feet plus a tangent line
  - Zero or Many is depicted by a circle and crows feet
  - max is next to the entity and then min is before the max on the line

### All possible combination of maximum and minimum

- one and only one two lines
- one or more one line + crows feet called as optional many
- Zero or one circle + one line optional one
- Zero or more optional many zero or more

### follow this rule

- start with each
- say the words at least
- at most

EX: for each actor has at least 1 movie and at most many movies

### Associative Entities

many to many still needs to be split into another entity

keep the cardinality definition and only one attached to the original entity
