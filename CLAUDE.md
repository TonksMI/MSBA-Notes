# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains academic course materials organized by course number:

- `BUS 659/`: Business course materials with Jupyter notebooks and notes
- `BUS 671/`: Business course materials with Jupyter notebooks and notes  
- `BUS 672/`: Business course materials with Jupyter notebooks and notes
- `CPSC 540/`: Computer Science course materials with Jupyter notebooks and notes

## Working with Course Materials

### Jupyter Notebooks
Each course directory contains a `Jupyter NoteBooks/` subdirectory with computational assignments and analyses. When working with these:

- Notebooks are likely data analysis, statistical modeling, or machine learning assignments
- May require Python data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)
- Use `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` to run and edit notebooks

### Notes
Each course has a `Notes/` subdirectory containing:
- Text files (`.txt`) with course notes
- Markdown files (`.md`) for formatted notes

## Development Environment

Since this is an academic repository focused on data analysis and coursework:

- Primary tools are likely Jupyter notebooks for computational work
- Python environment with data science packages may be required
- No build system, linting, or testing infrastructure is present as this contains academic materials rather than production code

## Course Context

- **BUS courses**: Likely business analytics, statistics, or quantitative methods
- **CPSC 540**: Advanced computer science course, possibly machine learning or advanced algorithms
