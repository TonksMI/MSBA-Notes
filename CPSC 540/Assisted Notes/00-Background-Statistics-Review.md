# Background: Statistics Fundamentals

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive review of statistical concepts essential for CPSC 540. These concepts bridge probability theory and machine learning applications, with extensive focus on real-world workplace applications where these statistical methods drive critical business decisions.

## Why Statistics Matter in the Workplace

Statistical methods are the foundation of data-driven decision making in modern organizations. From quality control in manufacturing to customer segmentation in marketing, statistical analysis transforms raw data into actionable business insights. Understanding these fundamentals enables professionals to:

1. **Make evidence-based decisions** rather than relying on intuition
2. **Quantify uncertainty** in business projections and risk assessments
3. **Design experiments** that provide reliable answers to business questions
4. **Communicate findings** with appropriate confidence levels
5. **Avoid statistical fallacies** that can lead to costly business mistakes

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency

#### Mean (Arithmetic Average)
```
x̄ = (1/n) Σᵢ xᵢ
```

**Properties:**
- Sensitive to outliers
- Minimizes sum of squared deviations
- E[X̄] = μ (unbiased estimator)

#### Median
Middle value when data is ordered.
- Robust to outliers
- 50th percentile

#### Mode
Most frequently occurring value.
- Useful for categorical data
- Can have multiple modes

**Example:**
```
Data: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 100]
Mean = 118/7 ≈ 16.9
Median = 3
Mode = 3
```

### Workplace Application: Executive Compensation Analysis

**Business Context:** HR department analyzing executive salaries to set compensation benchmarks.

**Real Scenario:** Tech company examining C-suite compensation across similar companies:
```python
# Executive compensation data (in millions)
salaries = [2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0, 15.2]  # One outlier (CEO with equity)

mean_salary = np.mean(salaries)     # $4.3M (inflated by outlier)
median_salary = np.median(salaries) # $2.5M (robust to outlier)
mode_salary = stats.mode(salaries)  # $2.5M (most common)
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Mean ($4.3M)**: Misleading due to one exceptional package
- **Median ($2.5M)**: Better representation of typical executive pay
- **Decision**: Use median for benchmarking to avoid inflated expectations

**Cost of Wrong Decision:** Using mean could lead to 72% overpayment in compensation budgeting.

### Workplace Application: Customer Satisfaction Metrics

**Business Context:** Restaurant chain measuring customer satisfaction scores.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding data spread helps identify consistency issues across locations.

```python
# Customer satisfaction scores (1-10 scale) for two restaurant locations
location_a = [7.2, 7.8, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.9]  # Consistent performance
location_b = [3.1, 6.8, 7.5, 8.2, 9.1, 9.3, 9.8]  # High variability

# Both have same mean (8.04) but very different spreads
mean_a = np.mean(location_a)  # 8.04
mean_b = np.mean(location_b)  # 8.04

std_a = np.std(location_a)    # 0.57 (consistent service)
std_b = np.std(location_b)    # 2.18 (inconsistent service)
```

**Business Decision:** Location A provides consistent experience; Location B needs operational improvements despite same average rating.

### Measures of Spread

#### Variance
**Population variance:**
```
σ² = (1/N) Σᵢ (xᵢ - μ)²
```

**Sample variance:**
```
s² = (1/(n-1)) Σᵢ (xᵢ - x̄)²
```

**Note:** Divide by (n-1) for sample variance (Bessel's correction) to get unbiased estimator.

#### Standard Deviation
```
σ = √σ², s = √s²
```

#### Range
```
Range = max(x) - min(x)
```

#### Interquartile Range (IQR)
```
IQR = Q₃ - Q₁
```

### Percentiles and Quantiles

#### Quantiles
- **Quartiles**: Q₁ (25%), Q₂ (50%, median), Q₃ (75%)
- **Deciles**: 10%, 20%, ..., 90%
- **Percentiles**: 1%, 2%, ..., 99%

#### Five-Number Summary
Min, Q₁, Median, Q₃, Max

### Workplace Application: Sales Performance Analysis

**Business Context:** Sales manager evaluating quarterly performance across sales representatives.

```python
# Quarterly sales figures (in thousands)
sales_data = [45, 67, 78, 82, 89, 95, 103, 115, 127, 134, 145, 167, 189, 205, 287]

# Five-number summary
min_sales = np.min(sales_data)        # $45K
q1 = np.percentile(sales_data, 25)    # $82K
median = np.median(sales_data)        # $115K
q3 = np.percentile(sales_data, 75)    # $167K
max_sales = np.max(sales_data)        # $287K
iqr = q3 - q1                         # $85K

# Identify outliers (beyond 1.5 * IQR from quartiles)
outlier_threshold_high = q3 + 1.5 * iqr  # $294.5K
outlier_threshold_low = q1 - 1.5 * iqr   # -$45.5K (impossible)
```

**Business Insights:**
- **Bottom 25%**: Need coaching (< $82K)
- **Top performer**: $287K (not quite an outlier, but exceptional)
- **Typical range**: $82K - $167K represents normal performance
- **Action**: Focus training resources on bottom quartile

**ROI Impact:** Targeted training for bottom quartile could increase average sales by 15%, worth $2.3M annually across 50-person sales team.

## 2. Sampling Distributions

### Sampling Distribution of the Mean
For samples of size n from population with mean μ and variance σ²:

```
X̄ ~ N(μ, σ²/n)  [if population is normal]
X̄ ≈ N(μ, σ²/n)  [if n is large, by CLT]
```

### Standard Error
Standard deviation of a sampling distribution:
```
SE(X̄) = σ/√n
```

When σ is unknown:
```
SE(X̄) = s/√n
```

### Distribution of Sample Variance
For samples from normal population:
```
(n-1)s²/σ² ~ χ²(n-1)
```

## 3. Confidence Intervals

### For Population Mean (σ known)
```
x̄ ± z_{α/2} × σ/√n
```

### For Population Mean (σ unknown)
```
x̄ ± t_{α/2,n-1} × s/√n
```

**Interpretation:** We are (1-α)×100% confident that the true population mean lies within this interval.

### Workplace Application: Manufacturing Quality Control

**Business Context:** Pharmaceutical company ensuring drug tablet weight meets regulatory requirements.

**Critical Decision:** FDA requires average tablet weight of 500mg ± 5% (475-525mg range).

```python
# Sample of 36 tablets from production line
weights = [498, 502, 495, 503, 501, ...]  # Sample data
n = 36
sample_mean = 499.2  # mg
sample_std = 8.4     # mg

# 95% Confidence interval for true mean weight
t_critical = 2.032   # t-value for α=0.05, df=35
margin_error = t_critical * (sample_std / np.sqrt(n))
# ME = 2.032 * (8.4 / 6) = 2.84

ci_lower = sample_mean - margin_error  # 496.36 mg
ci_upper = sample_mean + margin_error  # 502.04 mg

print(f"95% CI: [{ci_lower:.2f}, {ci_upper:.2f}] mg")
```

**Business Decision:** 
- **CI range**: [496.36, 502.04] mg
- **Regulatory requirement**: [475, 525] mg
- **Result**: Production meets FDA requirements with 95% confidence
- **Action**: Continue production without adjustment

**Cost Avoidance:** Avoiding unnecessary production shutdown saves $50,000 per day.

### For Population Proportion
```
p̂ ± z_{α/2} × √(p̂(1-p̂)/n)
```

**Example: 95% CI for mean height**
```
Sample: n=25, x̄=170cm, s=10cm
t₀.₀₂₅,₂₄ ≈ 2.064

CI = 170 ± 2.064 × (10/√25) = 170 ± 4.13 = [165.87, 174.13]
```

### Workplace Application: Clinical Trial Design

**Business Context:** Biotech company testing new cholesterol medication.

**Critical Business Question:** Does the new drug reduce cholesterol better than current standard?

```python
# Patient cholesterol reduction (mg/dL) after 3 months
control_group = [12, 18, 15, 22, 19, 16, 14, 20, 17, 13]    # Standard drug
treatment_group = [28, 32, 25, 35, 30, 27, 33, 29, 31, 26] # New drug

# Calculate confidence intervals
control_mean = np.mean(control_group)      # 16.6 mg/dL
treatment_mean = np.mean(treatment_group)  # 29.6 mg/dL

# 95% CI for difference
n1, n2 = len(control_group), len(treatment_group)
s1, s2 = np.std(control_group, ddof=1), np.std(treatment_group, ddof=1)

# Pooled standard error for difference
se_diff = np.sqrt(s1**2/n1 + s2**2/n2)
diff_mean = treatment_mean - control_mean  # 13.0 mg/dL improvement

t_critical = 2.101  # df = 18
ci_diff = [diff_mean - t_critical * se_diff, diff_mean + t_critical * se_diff]
print(f"95% CI for difference: [{ci_diff[0]:.1f}, {ci_diff[1]:.1f}] mg/dL")
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Improvement range**: 8.2 to 17.8 mg/dL with 95% confidence
- **Minimum benefit**: Still clinically significant (>5 mg/dL)
- **Investment decision**: Proceed with Phase III trials ($50M investment)
- **Market potential**: $2B annual revenue if successful

## 4. Hypothesis Testing

### Framework
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Status quo assumption
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: What we want to prove
3. **Test Statistic**: Measures evidence against H₀
4. **P-value**: Probability of observing data as extreme as observed, given H₀ is true
5. **Significance Level (α)**: Threshold for rejecting H₀
6. **Decision**: Reject H₀ if p-value < α

### Types of Tests

#### One-Sample t-test
**Hypotheses:**
```
H₀: μ = μ₀
H₁: μ ≠ μ₀  (two-sided)
H₁: μ > μ₀  (one-sided)
H₁: μ < μ₀  (one-sided)
```

**Test statistic:**
```
t = (x̄ - μ₀)/(s/√n) ~ t(n-1)
```

#### Two-Sample t-test
**Equal variances:**
```
t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂)/√(s²ₚ(1/n₁ + 1/n₂))

where s²ₚ = [(n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²]/(n₁+n₂-2)
```

**Unequal variances (Welch's t-test):**
```
t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂)/√(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)
```

#### Paired t-test
For dependent samples:
```
t = d̄/(s_d/√n)
```
where d̄ is mean of differences and s_d is standard deviation of differences.

### Workplace Application: A/B Testing for E-commerce

**Business Context:** Online retailer testing new checkout process to reduce cart abandonment.

**Business Question:** Does the new checkout design increase conversion rate?

```python
# A/B test results
# Control group (old checkout): 2,847 visitors, 312 conversions
# Treatment group (new checkout): 2,891 visitors, 365 conversions

control_conversions = 312
control_visitors = 2847
control_rate = control_conversions / control_visitors  # 10.96%

treatment_conversions = 365
treatment_visitors = 2891
treatment_rate = treatment_conversions / treatment_visitors  # 12.63%

# Two-proportion z-test
from scipy import stats

# Pooled proportion
pool_conversions = control_conversions + treatment_conversions
pool_visitors = control_visitors + treatment_visitors
pool_rate = pool_conversions / pool_visitors

# Test statistic
se_diff = np.sqrt(pool_rate * (1 - pool_rate) * (1/control_visitors + 1/treatment_visitors))
z_score = (treatment_rate - control_rate) / se_diff
p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z_score)))

print(f"Conversion rate improvement: {(treatment_rate - control_rate)*100:.2f}%")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

**Results:**
- **Improvement**: 1.67 percentage point increase (15.2% relative improvement)
- **P-value**: 0.0127 (statistically significant at α = 0.05)
- **Decision**: Implement new checkout process

**Business Impact:**
- **Revenue increase**: 15.2% improvement on $50M annual e-commerce revenue = $7.6M
- **Implementation cost**: $200K
- **ROI**: 3,700% return on investment

### Type I and Type II Errors

|          | H₀ True | H₀ False |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Reject H₀| Type I  | Correct  |
| Fail to  | Correct | Type II  |
| reject H₀|         |          |

- **Type I Error (α)**: Reject true H₀
- **Type II Error (β)**: Fail to reject false H₀
- **Power (1-β)**: Probability of correctly rejecting false H₀

### Workplace Application: Medical Device Quality Control

**Business Context:** Medical device manufacturer testing pacemaker battery life.

**Critical Decision Framework:**

| Decision | Battery ≥ 10 years (H₀ True) | Battery < 10 years (H₀ False) |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Approve Device** | ✓ Correct Decision | **Type II Error** |
| | (Good device approved) | (Defective device approved) |
| **Reject Device** | **Type I Error** | ✓ Correct Decision |
| | (Good device rejected) | (Defective device rejected) |

**Business Consequences:**
- **Type I Error**: Reject good device → $50M R&D loss, delayed market entry
- **Type II Error**: Approve bad device → $500M liability, regulatory shutdown, damaged reputation

**Optimal Strategy:**
- **Set α = 0.01** (1% chance of rejecting good device)
- **Require power ≥ 0.95** (95% chance of detecting bad device)
- **Justification**: Type II error consequences are 10x worse than Type I

```python
# Power analysis for pacemaker testing
from scipy.stats import norm

alpha = 0.01        # Type I error rate
beta_target = 0.05  # Type II error rate (power = 0.95)
mu_null = 10        # Null hypothesis: 10 year battery life
mu_alt = 9.5        # Alternative: detect if battery life < 9.5 years
sigma = 1.2         # Standard deviation of battery life

# Required sample size
z_alpha = norm.ppf(1 - alpha)  # Critical value
z_beta = norm.ppf(1 - beta_target)  # Power requirement

n_required = ((z_alpha + z_beta) * sigma / (mu_null - mu_alt))**2
print(f"Required sample size: {int(np.ceil(n_required))} devices")
print(f"Testing cost: ${int(np.ceil(n_required)) * 15000:,} per batch")
```

**Business Decision:** Test 35 devices per batch at $525K cost to ensure 95% power of detecting defective devices, preventing potential $500M liability.

### Workplace Application: Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

**Business Context:** Retail company comparing customer acquisition costs across different marketing channels.

**Business Question:** Do email, social media, and TV advertising have different customer acquisition costs?

```python
# Customer acquisition costs ($) by marketing channel
email_costs = [45, 52, 38, 48, 55, 42, 49, 46, 51, 44]      # Mean: $47
social_costs = [62, 68, 59, 71, 65, 63, 69, 66, 58, 67]     # Mean: $64.8
tv_costs = [98, 105, 92, 110, 88, 102, 95, 108, 91, 99]     # Mean: $98.8

# ANOVA test
from scipy.stats import f_oneway

f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(email_costs, social_costs, tv_costs)
print(f"F-statistic: {f_stat:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.2e}")

# Calculate effect sizes (practical significance)
email_mean = np.mean(email_costs)
social_mean = np.mean(social_costs) 
tv_mean = np.mean(tv_costs)

print(f"\nAcquisition costs:")
print(f"Email: ${email_mean:.0f}")
print(f"Social: ${social_mean:.0f} ({(social_mean/email_mean-1)*100:.0f}% higher)")
print(f"TV: ${tv_mean:.0f} ({(tv_mean/email_mean-1)*100:.0f}% higher)")
```

**Business Results:**
- **Statistical significance**: P < 0.001 (channels differ significantly)
- **Practical significance**: 
  - Social media: 38% more expensive than email
  - TV advertising: 110% more expensive than email

**Strategic Decision:** 
- **Reallocate budget**: Shift 40% of TV budget to email marketing
- **Expected outcome**: Acquire 50% more customers with same total budget
- **Revenue impact**: Additional $12M annual revenue from increased customer base

## 5. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

### One-Way ANOVA
Tests equality of means across k groups:
```
H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = ... = μₖ
H₁: At least one μᵢ differs
```

**Test statistic:**
```
F = MSB/MSW = [SSB/(k-1)]/[SSW/(N-k)]
```

where:
- SSB: Sum of squares between groups
- SSW: Sum of squares within groups
- MSB: Mean square between
- MSW: Mean square within

### Two-Way ANOVA
Examines effects of two factors and their interaction.

**Model:**
```
yᵢⱼₖ = μ + αᵢ + βⱼ + (αβ)ᵢⱼ + εᵢⱼₖ
```

### Workplace Application: Manufacturing Process Optimization

**Business Context:** Automobile manufacturer optimizing paint booth temperature, humidity, and pressure settings.

**Business Goal:** Minimize paint defects while controlling process variables.

```python
# Two-way ANOVA: Paint defects by temperature and humidity
# Temperature: Low (20°C), Medium (25°C), High (30°C)
# Humidity: Low (40%), High (60%)

import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Defects per 1000 parts
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'temperature': ['Low', 'Low', 'Medium', 'Medium', 'High', 'High'] * 10,
    'humidity': ['Low', 'High'] * 30,
    'defects': [12, 18, 8, 14, 15, 25, 10, 16, 6, 12, 13, 23, ...] # Sample data
})

# Main effects and interaction
low_temp_low_hum = data[(data['temperature']=='Low') & (data['humidity']=='Low')]['defects'].mean()
low_temp_high_hum = data[(data['temperature']=='Low') & (data['humidity']=='High')]['defects'].mean()
# ... similar for other combinations

print("Average defects per 1000 parts:")
print(f"Low Temp + Low Humidity: {low_temp_low_hum:.1f}")
print(f"Medium Temp + Low Humidity: 7.2 (optimal)")
print(f"High Temp + High Humidity: 24.8 (worst)")
```

**Business Findings:**
- **Main effect - Temperature**: Medium temperature (25°C) is optimal
- **Main effect - Humidity**: Low humidity (40%) reduces defects
- **Interaction effect**: High temperature + high humidity is particularly problematic
- **Optimal setting**: 25°C temperature, 40% humidity

**Business Impact:**
- **Defect reduction**: From 15.2 to 7.2 defects per 1000 parts (53% improvement)
- **Cost savings**: $2.8M annually in reduced rework and warranty claims
- **Quality improvement**: Customer satisfaction scores increase from 7.2 to 8.6

## 6. Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient
```
r = Σᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ) / √[Σᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)² Σᵢ(yᵢ - ȳ)²]
```

**Properties:**
- -1 ≤ r ≤ 1
- r = ±1 indicates perfect linear relationship
- r = 0 indicates no linear relationship

### Simple Linear Regression
**Model:**
```
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
```

**Least Squares Estimates:**
```
β̂₁ = Σᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ) / Σᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)²
β̂₀ = ȳ - β̂₁x̄
```

**Coefficient of Determination:**
```
R² = SSR/SST = 1 - SSE/SST
```

where:
- SST: Total sum of squares
- SSR: Regression sum of squares  
- SSE: Error sum of squares

### Workplace Application: Sales Forecasting

**Business Context:** SaaS company predicting monthly revenue based on marketing spend.

**Business Question:** How much additional revenue does each $1000 in marketing generate?

```python
# 24 months of data
marketing_spend = [50, 65, 45, 80, 70, 55, 90, 75, 60, 85, 95, 100, 
                  110, 85, 90, 105, 115, 95, 120, 110, 100, 125, 130, 115]
revenue = [780, 920, 710, 1150, 1020, 850, 1300, 1100, 900, 1250, 
          1380, 1450, 1580, 1300, 1350, 1520, 1650, 1400, 1720, 1600,
          1450, 1800, 1850, 1680]

# Linear regression
from scipy.stats import linregress

slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(marketing_spend, revenue)

print(f"Revenue = {intercept:.0f} + {slope:.2f} × Marketing Spend")
print(f"R² = {r_value**2:.3f} (explains {r_value**2*100:.1f}% of variance)")
print(f"P-value = {p_value:.4f}")

# Business interpretation
print(f"\nBusiness Insights:")
print(f"• Each $1K in marketing generates ${slope:.0f} in revenue")
print(f"• ROI: {(slope-1)*100:.0f}% return on marketing investment")
print(f"• Base revenue (no marketing): ${intercept:.0f}K")
```

**Results:**
- **Equation**: Revenue = $245K + $12.8 × Marketing Spend
- **ROI**: 1,180% return (each $1K marketing → $12.8K revenue)
- **R² = 0.892**: Marketing spend explains 89% of revenue variance
- **P < 0.001**: Highly significant relationship

**Strategic Decisions:**
- **Increase marketing budget** from current $100K to $150K monthly
- **Expected revenue increase**: $150K × 12.8 = $1.92M monthly
- **Profit impact**: $640K additional monthly profit (assuming 40% margin)

### Assumptions of Linear Regression
1. **Linearity**: Relationship between X and Y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of errors
4. **Normality**: Errors are normally distributed

### Workplace Application: Real Estate Valuation Model

**Business Context:** Real estate company building automated valuation model for loan approvals.

**Critical Business Need:** Accurate property valuations within 10% to minimize loan default risk.

```python
# Checking regression assumptions with diagnostic plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import shapiro

# Multiple regression: Price ~ Size + Age + Location Score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = pd.DataFrame({
    'size_sqft': [1200, 1800, 2200, 1500, 2800, 1900, 1600, 2400, 1100, 2000],

# Fit model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
predicted = model.predict(X)
residuals = y - predicted

# 1. Linearity check: Residuals vs. predicted
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.scatter(predicted, residuals)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Residuals vs. Predicted (Linearity Check)')

# 2. Homoscedasticity: Scale-location plot
plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.scatter(predicted, np.sqrt(np.abs(residuals)))
plt.title('Scale-Location Plot (Homoscedasticity)')

print(f"Shapiro-Wilk test p-value: {shapiro_p:.4f}")
print(f"Normality assumption: {'Satisfied' if shapiro_p > 0.05 else 'Violated'}")
```

**Model Validation Results:**
- **Linearity**: ✓ No clear pattern in residuals
- **Homoscedasticity**: ✓ Constant variance across predictions
- **Normality**: ✓ Residuals approximately normal (p = 0.342)
- **Independence**: ✓ No autocorrelation in residuals

**Business Confidence:**
- **Model accuracy**: 92% of predictions within ±8% of actual value
- **Risk management**: Automated system approved for loans up to $750K
- **Efficiency gain**: 75% reduction in manual appraisal costs
- **Revenue protection**: Prevented estimated $2.3M in bad loans over 6 months

## 7. Multiple Linear Regression

### Model
```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₚxₚ + ε
```

**Matrix form:**
```
y = Xβ + ε
```

### Normal Equations
```
β̂ = (X'X)⁻¹X'y
```

### Properties of β̂
- **Unbiased**: E[β̂] = β
- **Minimum variance**: Among all unbiased linear estimators (Gauss-Markov)

### Workplace Application: IT System Performance

**Business Context:** Software company optimizing database query performance across multiple servers.

**Business Challenge:** Query response times are highly skewed (not normal), making traditional t-tests inappropriate.

```python
# Query response times (milliseconds) - highly skewed data
server_a = [45, 52, 48, 51, 203, 49, 47, 46, 189, 50]  # Some outliers
server_b = [67, 71, 69, 68, 70, 72, 74, 66, 73, 75]    # Consistently slower

# Traditional t-test (inappropriate due to non-normality)
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
t_stat, t_p = ttest_ind(server_a, server_b)
print(f"T-test p-value: {t_p:.4f} (potentially unreliable)")

# Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (robust alternative)
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu
u_stat, u_p = mannwhitneyu(server_a, server_b, alternative='two-sided')
print(f"Mann-Whitney U test p-value: {u_p:.4f} (reliable)")

# Effect size (rank-based)
n1, n2 = len(server_a), len(server_b)
effect_size = 1 - (2 * u_stat) / (n1 * n2)  # Probability of superiority
print(f"Effect size: {effect_size:.3f} (Server A faster {effect_size*100:.1f}% of time)")
```

**Business Results:**
- **Statistical conclusion**: Server A significantly faster (p = 0.016)
- **Practical significance**: Server A outperforms Server B 73% of the time
- **Decision**: Migrate production workload to Server A configuration

**Business Impact:**

#### Mann-Whitney U Test
Non-parametric alternative to two-sample t-test.
- Tests if two populations have same distribution
- Based on ranks rather than actual values

#### Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
Non-parametric alternative to paired t-test.
- Tests median difference is zero
- Uses ranks of absolute differences

#### Kruskal-Wallis Test
Non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA.
- Extends Mann-Whitney to more than two groups

#### Spearman Rank Correlation
Non-parametric measure of monotonic relationship:
```
ρₛ = 1 - (6Σdᵢ²)/(n(n²-1))
```
where dᵢ is difference in ranks.

### Workplace Application: Customer Segmentation

**Business Context:** E-commerce platform analyzing relationship between customer demographics and purchase behavior.

**Business Question:** Is there a relationship between age group and product category preferences?

```python
# Contingency table: Age Group vs. Product Category
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Observed frequencies
data = pd.crosstab(
    index=['18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', '55+'],
    columns=['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home & Garden', 'Sports'],
    values=[[145, 89, 34, 78],   # 18-25
            [167, 134, 67, 92],   # 26-35  
            [134, 156, 134, 67],  # 36-45
            [89, 145, 178, 45],   # 46-55
            [67, 98, 203, 23]]    # 55+
)

# Chi-square test of independence
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(data)
print(f"Chi-square statistic: {chi2:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.2e}")
print(f"Degrees of freedom: {dof}")

# Calculate Cramér's V (effect size)
n = data.sum().sum()
cramers_v = np.sqrt(chi2 / (n * (min(data.shape) - 1)))
print(f"Cramér's V: {cramers_v:.3f} (effect size)")

# Business interpretation
print("\nKey Patterns:")
for age in data.index:
    max_category = data.loc[age].idxmax()
    percentage = (data.loc[age, max_category] / data.loc[age].sum()) * 100
    print(f"{age}: Prefer {max_category} ({percentage:.1f}% of purchases)")
```

## 9. Chi-Square Tests

### Goodness of Fit Test
Tests if data follows specified distribution:
```
χ² = Σᵢ (Oᵢ - Eᵢ)²/Eᵢ
```
where Oᵢ is observed frequency and Eᵢ is expected frequency.

### Test of Independence
Tests if two categorical variables are independent:
```
χ² = ΣᵢΣⱼ (Oᵢⱼ - Eᵢⱼ)²/Eᵢⱼ
```

**Expected frequency:**
```
Eᵢⱼ = (Row i total × Column j total)/Grand total
```

### Workplace Application: Market Research Validation

               8.2, 7.5, 7.8, 6.7, 8.4, 7.3, 7.6, 8.1, 7.0, 7.9,
               8.0, 7.2, 7.8, 6.8, 8.3, 7.1, 7.7, 8.2, 7.4, 7.6,
               8.1, 7.3, 7.9, 6.9, 8.0, 7.5, 7.8, 7.2, 8.4, 7.7,
               7.4, 8.1, 7.6, 7.3, 7.8]

original_mean = np.mean(brand_scores)  # 7.56
n_samples = len(brand_scores)

# Bootstrap resampling (B = 10,000 bootstrap samples)
n_bootstrap = 10000
bootstrap_means = []

for i in range(n_bootstrap):
    # Resample with replacement
    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(brand_scores, size=n_samples, replace=True)
    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))

bootstrap_means = np.array(bootstrap_means)

# Bootstrap confidence intervals
ci_lower = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)   # 2.5th percentile
ci_upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)  # 97.5th percentile
bootstrap_se = np.std(bootstrap_means)

print(f"Original sample mean: {original_mean:.3f}")
print(f"Bootstrap SE: {bootstrap_se:.3f}")
print(f"95% Bootstrap CI: [{ci_lower:.3f}, {ci_upper:.3f}]")

# Compare with theoretical CI (assuming normality)
theoretical_se = np.std(brand_scores, ddof=1) / np.sqrt(n_samples)
theoretical_ci = [original_mean - 1.96 * theoretical_se, 
                 original_mean + 1.96 * theoretical_se]
print(f"Theoretical 95% CI: [{theoretical_ci[0]:.3f}, {theoretical_ci[1]:.3f}]")

## 10. Resampling Methods

### Bootstrap
Resampling with replacement to estimate sampling distribution.

**Procedure:**
1. Draw B bootstrap samples of size n with replacement
2. Compute statistic θ̂* for each bootstrap sample
3. Use distribution of θ̂* to estimate properties of θ̂

**Applications:**
- Estimate standard error: SE(θ̂) ≈ √Var(θ̂*)
- Confidence intervals: Percentile method

### Cross-Validation
Technique for model assessment and selection.

#### k-Fold Cross-Validation
1. Divide data into k roughly equal folds
2. For each fold i:
   - Train model on remaining k-1 folds
   - Test on fold i
3. Average performance across all folds

#### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
Special case where k = n.

### Workplace Application: Cross-Validation for Credit Scoring

**Business Context:** Bank developing machine learning model for loan approval decisions.

**Critical Business Need:** Accurate model performance estimates to minimize default risk while maximizing approval rates.

```python
# Credit scoring model validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

# Simulated credit data (features: income, debt_ratio, credit_history_length, etc.)
X = credit_features  # Customer financial profiles
y = default_labels   # 0 = paid back, 1 = defaulted

# 5-fold cross-validation
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Performance metrics across folds
accuracy_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kf, scoring='accuracy')
precision_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kf, scoring='precision')
recall_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kf, scoring='recall')

print("Cross-Validation Results:")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_scores.mean():.3f} ± {accuracy_scores.std():.3f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision_scores.mean():.3f} ± {precision_scores.std():.3f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall_scores.mean():.3f} ± {recall_scores.std():.3f}")

# Business interpretation
expected_accuracy = accuracy_scores.mean()
accuracy_uncertainty = accuracy_scores.std()

print(f"\nBusiness Impact Assessment:")
print(f"Expected accuracy: {expected_accuracy:.1%} ± {accuracy_uncertainty:.1%}")
print(f"Default detection rate: {recall_scores.mean():.1%}")
print(f"False positive rate: {1 - precision_scores.mean():.1%}")
```

**Business Results:**
- **Model accuracy**: 87.3% ± 2.1% (consistent performance)
- **Default detection**: 82.4% of actual defaults caught
- **False positive rate**: 11.2% (good customers incorrectly flagged)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Model reliability**: Low variance (2.1%) indicates stable performance
- **Production deployment**: Safe to implement with 87% expected accuracy
- **Business trade-offs**: Balance between risk (missed defaults) and opportunity (rejected good customers)

**Financial Impact:**

- **2ᵏ factorial**: k factors, each at 2 levels
- Allows study of main effects and interactions

### Workplace Application: Clinical Trial Design

**Business Context:** Pharmaceutical company planning Phase III trial for new arthritis drug.

**Critical Decision:** Determine optimal sample size to detect clinically meaningful improvement while controlling costs.

```python
# Power analysis for drug efficacy trial
from scipy.stats import norm, ttest_ind_from_stats
import numpy as np

# Clinical parameters
control_mean = 6.5      # Current pain score (0-10 scale)
treatment_mean = 5.0    # Target pain score with new drug
common_std = 2.1        # Standard deviation from previous studies
alpha = 0.05            # Type I error rate
power_target = 0.80     # Desired power (80%)

# Effect size calculation
effect_size = (control_mean - treatment_mean) / common_std  # Cohen's d = 0.714

# Sample size calculation
def calculate_sample_size(effect_size, alpha, power):
    z_alpha = norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)  # Two-tailed test
    z_beta = norm.ppf(power)
    
    n_per_group = ((z_alpha + z_beta) / effect_size) ** 2
    return int(np.ceil(n_per_group))

n_per_group = calculate_sample_size(effect_size, alpha, power_target)
total_n = 2 * n_per_group

print(f"Sample Size Analysis:")
print(f"Effect size (Cohen's d): {effect_size:.3f} (medium-large effect)")
print(f"Required sample size: {n_per_group} per group")
print(f"Total participants needed: {total_n}")

# Cost-benefit analysis
cost_per_participant = 8500    # Clinical trial cost per person
trial_cost = total_n * cost_per_participant

print(f"\nBusiness Impact:")
print(f"Trial cost: ${trial_cost:,}")
print(f"Market potential: $2.8B annually if successful")
print(f"Probability of success with {power_target*100}% power: {power_target:.0%}")

# Sensitivity analysis - different power levels
power_levels = [0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90]
for power in power_levels:
    n = calculate_sample_size(effect_size, alpha, power)
    cost = 2 * n * cost_per_participant
    print(f"Power {power:.0%}: n={2*n:3d}, cost=${cost/1e6:.1f}M")
```

**Business Analysis:**
- **Recommended design**: 32 participants per group (64 total)
- **Trial cost**: $544,000
- **Power**: 80% chance of detecting 1.5-point pain reduction
- **Effect size**: Medium-large (Cohen's d = 0.714)

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **85% power option**: Additional $68K investment for 5% higher success probability
- **Market risk**: $2.8B market opportunity justifies higher-powered study
- **Regulatory requirement**: FDA typically expects 80%+ power

**Final Recommendation:** 90% power design (38 per group, $646K total cost)
- **Justification**: Only 19% cost increase for 10% higher success probability
- **Risk mitigation**: Reduces chance of inconclusive results
- **ROI**: Potential $2.8B revenue vs. $646K investment = 4,300x return

## 12. Power Analysis

```python
# Demand forecasting model diagnostics
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import shapiro, jarque_bera, normaltest
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan, acorr_ljungbox

# Monthly demand data with seasonal trend
demand_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'month': range(1, 37),  # 3 years of data
    'temperature': [22, 24, 28, 35, 42, 48, 52, 51, 45, 38, 30, 25, ...],  # Seasonal
    'marketing_spend': [50, 55, 60, 45, 40, 35, 30, 35, 40, 50, 55, 60, ...],
    'demand': [2840, 3120, 3650, 4200, 4850, 5340, 5680, 5520, 4920, 4100, 3300, 2950, ...]
})

# Fit demand forecasting model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = demand_data[['temperature', 'marketing_spend']]
y = demand_data['demand']

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
predicted = model.predict(X)
residuals = y - predicted

print("Model Performance:")
print(f"R²: {model.score(X, y):.3f}")
print(f"RMSE: {np.sqrt(np.mean(residuals**2)):.0f} units")

# 1. Normality of Residuals
shapiro_stat, shapiro_p = shapiro(residuals)
jb_stat, jb_p = jarque_bera(residuals)

print(f"\n1. Normality Tests:")
print(f"Shapiro-Wilk p-value: {shapiro_p:.4f}")
print(f"Jarque-Bera p-value: {jb_p:.4f}")
print(f"Normality assumption: {'✓ Satisfied' if shapiro_p > 0.05 else '✗ Violated'}")

# 2. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
corr_resid_pred, p_homosced = spearmanr(np.abs(residuals), predicted)

print(f"\n2. Homoscedasticity:")
print(f"Residuals vs. Fitted correlation: {corr_resid_pred:.3f} (p={p_homosced:.4f})")
print(f"Constant variance: {'✓ Satisfied' if p_homosced > 0.05 else '✗ Violated'}")

# 3. Independence (No Autocorrelation)
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import acf
autocorr = acf(residuals, nlags=6)
max_autocorr = np.max(np.abs(autocorr[1:]))

print(f"\n3. Independence:")
print(f"Maximum autocorrelation: {max_autocorr:.3f}")
print(f"Independence assumption: {'✓ Satisfied' if max_autocorr < 0.3 else '✗ Violated'}")

# 4. Linearity
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
temp_resid_corr, p_temp = pearsonr(X['temperature'], residuals)
mark_resid_corr, p_mark = pearsonr(X['marketing_spend'], residuals)

print(f"\n4. Linearity:")
print(f"Temperature-residuals correlation: {temp_resid_corr:.3f} (p={p_temp:.4f})")
print(f"Marketing-residuals correlation: {mark_resid_corr:.3f} (p={p_mark:.4f})")
print(f"Linearity assumption: {'✓ Satisfied' if max(p_temp, p_mark) > 0.05 else '✗ Violated'}")
```

**Diagnostic Results:**
- **Normality**: ✓ Satisfied (p = 0.342) - prediction intervals are valid
- **Homoscedasticity**: ✓ Satisfied (p = 0.891) - consistent prediction accuracy
- **Independence**: ✗ Violated (max autocorr = 0.52) - seasonal patterns remain
- **Linearity**: ✓ Satisfied - linear relationships appropriate

**Business Implications:**

**Violated Assumption - Independence:**
- **Problem**: Seasonal autocorrelation in residuals
- **Business risk**: Underestimated uncertainty, poor seasonal forecasts
- **Solution**: Add seasonal terms or use time series model

**Corrective Action:**
```python
# Add seasonal components
demand_data['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * demand_data['month'] / 12)
demand_data['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * demand_data['month'] / 12)

# Refit model with seasonal terms
X_seasonal = demand_data[['temperature', 'marketing_spend', 'month_sin', 'month_cos']]
model_improved = LinearRegression().fit(X_seasonal, y)
new_residuals = y - model_improved.predict(X_seasonal)

# Check independence again
new_autocorr = acf(new_residuals, nlags=6)
print(f"Improved model max autocorr: {np.max(np.abs(new_autocorr[1:])):.3f}")
```

**Business Impact of Proper Diagnostics:**
- **Forecast accuracy**: Improved from 85% to 94% with seasonal terms
- **Inventory optimization**: Reduced carrying costs by $2.1M annually
- **Stockout prevention**: 67% reduction in lost sales due to understocking
